==================
      v1.2
12th December 2006
==================

- New MOD support system
    Mods can be loaded and unloaded in-game from a new MODs window.
    Mod authors can provide details on their MOD : a screenshot and a data 
    file, which will be shown in the MODs window when the mod is selected.

    MODs can be made to give Defcon a complete graphical makeover, eg making
    the entire game look like it's set in space.  Or they can be entirely new
    maps - eg Defcon played out over a map of Australia, with new territories
    and cities to match.

    There are two types of MOD:
        Critical MOD : required by all players connecting, eg a new Map
        Non critical MOD : graphical/audio only mod

    When joining a game server any Critical mods that are required will be 
    activated.  If those mods are not installed you will not be able to join.
    The Server Browser now has a new column to show what MODs are running.

    Servers that are running MODs you do NOT have installed will now show up 
    yellow in the Server Browser (as opposed to Red which signifies they are
    running an incompatible version)           


- Additional minor MOD support
    Image "data/graphics/explosion.bmp" is now only used by Explosions.  
    Previously it was used to render population and radiation, making it 
    impossible to mod explosion graphics without modding those too.


- New preferences option : RenderNodes 
    Very usefull for people making new maps for Defcon.
    Set this option to 1 (by editing your preferences.txt file) to render the 
    Nodes used in-game.  Red = AI Target, Green = AI Placement, White = Travel
    The white lines represent the possible routes ships can sail along.
    If you have a team selected the Red AI Target markers will fill to indicate
    a sensible target within striking range of any enemy.    


=================
      v1.1
18th October 2006
=================       

- Improvements to the Server Browser Window

    The number of players in any game is now rendered visually:
        Bright green box = human player
        Dull green box = CPU player
        Grey box = open slot
        This makes it much easier to see at a glance which games are interesting

    The Server browser no longer displays the version column (eg Defcon v1.0)
    The Server browser now displays the Game Mode in its own column

    The Server browser will remember which servers you have joined recently.
        They will be drawn highlighted in your list, so you can see them at a 
        glance.  The browser will store the previous 10 connected servers, and
        will also save the list and reload automatically when restarting.
        Note: Does not save your own game servers that you connected to
        - Makes it easier to see which games are not worth trying again
        - Makes it easier to rejoin a game you got disconnected from

    Can now filter the list :
        All Games
        Games In Lobby only
        Games In Progress only
        Recently joined Servers only
        LAN Games only

    In addition, you can choose to filter out less desirable server types:
        Hide single player games  (games in progress with just 1 human player)
        Hide demo games           (games created by a demo user, 2 players max)
        Hide default named games  (ie games with the name 'New Game Server')
        (Click on the Filters button to access these options)

    You can sort the server list by clicking on the column headings
        Sort by name (alphabetically)
        Sort by Game Mode
        Sort by Game Time
        Sort by Num spectators
        Sort by Num players             (sorts by num human players)
        Click once to sort by that column
        Click again to sort backwards by that column
        Click again to return to default sorting

    The 'Server Details' window (opened by right clicking on a server) now 
    includes a button to Join the server you are observing.
